This GitHub page contains all the datasets and code for the paper titled "Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes".

## Datasets:

All the publicly available datasets used for evaluation are in the [dataset](dataset) folder, including [all the sythetic clinical notes](dataset/phenopacet_store_clinical_notes_final) generated by Phenopacket-Store and the [selected cohort](dataset/phenopacket_store_filtered_final) of 5,980 clinical notes used for testing. Additionally, we include the [pubmed_free_text](dataset/pubmed_free_text) with 255 literature-derived clinical notes, which is originally compiled in [LLM-Gene-Prioritization](https://github.com/stormliucong/LLM-Gene-Prioritization/blob/main/data/input/new_free_text_pmid_input.csv) for [this paper](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(24)00296-9).

Phenopacket-derived clinical notes were synthesized by us in ChatGPT with a specific prompting strategy. If you use the Phenopacket-derived clinical notes in your studies, please cite both the Phenopacket paper and our paper.
